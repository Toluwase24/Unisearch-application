                <p class="text-center p-2">Universities and colleges have been around in the world for centuries. In recent decades, obtaining a degree has become
                essential for increased long-term financial gain, job stability, career satisfaction and overall success. There were
                approximately 18.99 million college students in the U.S. in 2020, with around 13.87 million enrolled in public colleges
                and a further 5.12 million students enrolled in private colleges. In the United States alone, there are approximately
                5,300 universities. These colleges and universities offer a wide range of programs and features, from beauty schools to
                private Ivy League research universities like Harvard University.</p>
                <p class="text-center p-2">The college application process can feel intimidating, especially for those who are first generation students. The
                numerous steps involved, like essay writing, obtaining letters of recommendations, and navigating scholarships can feel
                incredibly intimidating. With each of these universities having different requirements and application sites, the
                process can easily become tiring.</p>
